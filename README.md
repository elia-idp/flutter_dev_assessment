Flutter Developer Assessment

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for the assessment. The project includes one page showing a counter that is initially zero and increased each time the button is clicked.

* The counter is no longer needed to be shown.
* You should replace the button with a new icon that the user clicks to report inappropriate content or mistake.
* On the first click, the endpoint "http://demo1645562.mockable.io/feedback" should receive the message. 
´´´
{'feedback': 'mistake'}
´´´
* If the user continue clicking the button, a popup should show the message of "The feedback is already received". 
* Please pay attention on error handling.
